# Airflow Python Dependencies
# =============================================================================
# Versions are intentionally unpinned for packages covered by Airflow's
# constraints file (constraints-<AIRFLOW_VERSION>/constraints-<PYTHON>.txt).
# The constraints file pins every transitive dependency to versions tested
# against the exact Airflow release, preventing conflicts.
#
# Only pin versions for packages NOT present in the constraints file.
